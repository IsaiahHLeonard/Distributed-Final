Distributed-Final
=================

The watch apps are in the pebbleDirectionsApp and the pebbleGeofenceApp folders. Inside these folders, the json file is the
general information file for the watch app, so the name and so on. Inside, there is another folder src, and inside this 
folder is the actual C code for the app itself. 

The arduinoServer folder contains the code for our arduino.

The rest of the files are the setup and actual files for the android app. The java files for the android, are in the
DistributedDirections/src/main/java/com/distributed/directions folder. The xml files which are the layout and how the
android pages look are in the DistributedDirections/src/main/res/layout folder.
